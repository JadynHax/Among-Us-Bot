# Among Us Bot
An Among Us Discord bot I'm making to ~~take advantage of the trend~~ let people have fun with others on Discord with it.

It's (obviously) going to be fairly different than the *actual* Among Us, but I hope the new features/conveniences I'm adding will make up for the bot's inherent shortcomings, due to it being a bot and not a video game.

**NOTE:** The bot is not yet fully complete. I have a project in the Projects tab to give people an idea of the progress I'm making in completing it. This is namely meant to be a place to keep all the code I'm using to make the bot, and not a standalone, run-it-yourself bot; however, as I *have* licensed it under GNU/GPL v3.0, you *can* physically use the code and fork the repo, as long as you release that code under the same license if you make changes.
